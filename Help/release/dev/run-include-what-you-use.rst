run-include-what-you-use
------------------------

* The :ref:`Makefile Generators` and the :generator:`Ninja` generator
  learned to optionally run ``include-what-you-use`` along with the
  compiler for ``C`` and ``CXX`` languages.  See the
  :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE` variable and
  :prop_tgt:`<LANG>_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE` target property for details.
