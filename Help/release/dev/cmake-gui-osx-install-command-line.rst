cmake-gui-osx-install-command-line
----------------------------------

* On OS X the :manual:`cmake-gui(1)` no longer has the
  ``Install For Command Line Use`` menu item.  Instead there
  is a ``How to Install For Command Line Use`` menu item
  that shows an informational dialog box explaining how to
  make the command line tools available.  For example::

    /Applications/CMake.app/Contents/bin/cmake-gui --install
