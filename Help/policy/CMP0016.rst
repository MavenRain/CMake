.. cmake-policy:: CMP0016

In CMake 2.8.2 and lower the target_link_libraries() command silently
ignored if it was called with only one argument, and this argument
wasn't a valid target.  In CMake 2.8.3 and above it reports an error
in this case.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.3.  CMake version
|release| warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior.  Use
the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly.
